## Overview of Project

The purpose of the project is to determine the year-round sustainability of the surf and ice-cream shop business. In the analysis, we will look at December and June and see if there is a signficant difference between the temperatures in order to see if our business will be impacted by the seasonality of the weather.


### Results

Differences between December and June temperatures:
- Minium temperature - The min temperature for december is 56 degrees Fahrenheit and the minimum temperature for June is 64 degrees Fahrenheit
- Standard Deviation - The standard deviation for December is larger than the standard deviation for June (3.7 degrees Fahrenheit for December and 3.3 degrees Fahrenheit for June)
- Mean temperature - the mean temperature for June is slightly lower than the mean temperature for December (71 degrees Fahrenheit for December and 74.9 degrees Fahrenheit for June)

### Summary

Overall, December is slightly colder and has slightly more variability in temperature than June.

Two additional queries I would perform would be:
- Run the same analysis for precipitation data to determine if there is a difference in the amount of rain in each month.
- Do the original query for each year in order to determine if the year to year temperature trends are consistent from year to year.
